# Research
At PQC lab, we are dedicated to advancing the foundations and applications of quantum computing with a current focus on security, reliability, machine learning, and fault-tolerance. 

## Security and Forensics in Quantum Systems

As quantum computers become more capable, so does the need for **trustworthy and tamper-resistant quantum hardware and software**. Our work focuses on:

- Reverse engineering and adversarial attacks in quantum devices
- Secure training and execution of Quantum Machine Learning systems
- Trustworthy compilation and verification of quantum programs
- Threat modeling for quantum supply chains and quantum cloud systems

We investigate adversarial threats in modern quantum computing systems and design security measures for the same.

## Quantum Machine Learning

## Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance

Quantum systems are inherently fragile owing to the presence of environmental noise and low qubit decoherence, making **quantum error correction** essential for reliable computation. We investigate:

- Surface codes and topological error-correcting strategies
- Low-overhead and hardware-aware QEC schemes
- Design space optimization of near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture
- Simulation frameworks to evaluate QEC performance under noise

The best way to get a sense of whatâ€™s currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members.
