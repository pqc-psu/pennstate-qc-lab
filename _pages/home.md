### About the Lab

We are a group of Quantum Computing researchers (read enthusiasts)! Led by Dr. Swaroop Ghosh, our research expands into diverse areas in quantum. At the moment, we focus on the security of quantum cloud systems, quantum machine learning in drug discovery, and near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.
